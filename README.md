# myframe

My own little framework.
It acts like Angular and gives you wonderfull understanding of how Angular works underneath.
It also gives you an overview how you can write not only your framework but also your own little library like jQuery.

All you need is ` npm install` to install packages.
After reading the files surely you will start coding in Angular much easier.


To run webpack server ` npm run start `.


And to build the project ` npm run build `.

Entering live server mode your project will be available on port *localhost:4200"*.
